 Hospital Blood Bank Management System

The Hospital Blood Bank Management System is a Django-based web application designed to streamline the process of blood donation and availability management between hospitals and receivers.

The project focuses on two main user roles: Hospitals and Receivers.

Hospitals can register, log in, add blood sample details to their blood bank, and organize blood donation campaigns.

Receivers can register with their blood group, browse available blood samples from different hospitals, request blood samples, and also view upcoming donation campaigns.

Additionally, the system provides public access to available blood samples and donation campaigns, so that even users who are not logged in can view these details.
